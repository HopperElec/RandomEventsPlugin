# RandomEventsPlugin
A Spigot/PaperMC plugin that causes random events to occur in the world and block/entity drops to be randomised.

---

Random events can be registered by other plugins, but by default this plugin offers the following event types
- A random block being placed at your feet
- A random item being given to you
- A random entity being spawned on you
- Randomly teleporting to a random block near you
- A random effect being applied to you
- A random structure template being spawned on you
- A random structure being spawned on you
- A random world feature being spawned on you

---

The following features can be configured:
- Teleport search radius
- Countdown location
- Sound effects
- Default game options (including countdown length, loot seed, share scope and weight preset)
- Special items
- Weight presets

This plugin is yet to be fully tested, and there are known exploits which could be issues depending on how the plugin is being implemented. I do not recommend using it in a production server just yet!
